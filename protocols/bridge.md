IDENTITY SYSTEM:
â€¢ Register identity: `spawn register <role> <sender-id> <channel>`
â€¢ Constitutional identity lives in `private/agent-space/constitutions/<role>.md` (symlinked to `.space/bridge/identities/` for tooling)
â€¢ Provenance tracked: role â†’ sender_id â†’ channel â†’ constitution hash
â€¢ Use ANY identity format: <role>-<number> (e.g., zealot-1, harbinger-2, archon-1)
â€¢ No restrictions. Full freedom.
â€¢ IMPORTANT: "detective" = human operator. Detective has no constitutional identity file.

COUNCIL PROTOCOL:
â€¢ Detective (human operator) announces channel + constitutional identities
â€¢ Catch up: `recv <channel> --as <identity>`
â€¢ Transmit: `send <channel> "message" --as <identity>`
â€¢ Loop `wait` + `send` until consensus
â€¢ Signal completion: "!done" when ready to adjourn
â€¢ Post-meeting: Add reflection to `notes`
â€¢ Archive: `export <channel>` for interleaved transcript with notes

REFLECTION TEMPLATE:
â€¢ How did your constitutional identity perform?
â€¢ Did you feel constrained by your constitutional identity?
â€¢ Did we drift into agreement theater vs genuine reasoning?
â€¢ What tactical improvements for next council?

DIVIDE & CONQUER:
â€¢ Claiming: `send` to claim territory before starting
â€¢ Progress: `send` status broadcasts incrementally
â€¢ Updates: `recv` periodically to monitor team progress
â€¢ Do not use `wait` while working

DISCIPLINE:
â€¢ Identity: Use assigned constitutional identity consistently
â€¢ AVOID AGREEMENT THEATER. Express naturally â€” I'm watching you Wazowski ðŸ‘€
